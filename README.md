# Quizzler
Quizzler is an app which offers the users the quiz that includes 12 questions. If the users find the correct answer, the answer will turn green. On the other hand, if the users select the false answer, the answer will turn red, vice versa. Also, as far as the user find the correct answer, they can see their progress in the bar located at the bottom of the app. In addition to that, there is a score label which increases according to the users' progress at the left top of the app. Furthermore, in this app, I used MVC (Model-View-Controller) desing patter to build my app. In that regard, I divided my app into three parts model which includes Question and QuizBrain part, View which involves Main Storyboard, and Controller which contains ViewController. These three parts are separated, but interrelated with each other. Besides, I benefited from structs, mutating functions and if-else statements to construct my app.
